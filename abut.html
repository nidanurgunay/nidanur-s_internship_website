			<p class="par">I have born on 8th January 1998, Turkey. I have graduated from Bilfen Science and Technology highschool with the high-honor scholarship. After being 2000th person between more than 2 million participant in university election exam, i had opportunity to register to Sabanci University which is the top ranked university in Turkey. Mathematics is always interested and amazed me.Since logic behind the computer science is based on mathematics, i have choosed computer science as my major. After understanding computer science itself, i have seen the commmon principles between computers and human brain. Thus I have decided to do psychology minor. I have always tried to be a versatile person and i have tried to spend a time what i currently interests. This approach gives me the enough level knowledge in various areas in both computer science and noncomputer science. I am currently an erasmus student in Twente University, Netherlands, and i have applied for erasmus+ internship program. Thus i will assure to hiring manager that there will not be any problem such as sponsorship etc.   </p>
